DJANGO:

POA:
- make project folder
- make apps in project


	*this is from corey schafer's lessons.

	*assumes installation of django>=2.1

1) --IN COMMAND LINE:-- go to directory where the project will reside and enter
   in CLI-> "django-admin startproject <name of project>"
   project folder structure:
   [project folder]
   |____ [another folder w same name as project folder]
   |	  |____ __init__.py # blank init file to indicate this is a package
   |	  |____ settings.py # settings and config for project
   |	  |____ urls.py     # where we set up urls to page mapping
   |	  |____ wsgi.py     # how project & webserver communicate (won't touch)
   |____ manage.py          # this allows us to run cmdl commands
   
   * you can technically run the empty website now by calling "python manage.py 
     runserver", but it wil be empty.
   * http://127.0.0.1/ == localhost, you can swap in URL if desired.
   
2) /urls.py is a file that helps map URLs to certain locations so they can be 
   handled in a certain way
   
** CREATING APPS **

	* Django's principe is that you have a website project, inside of which
	  contains multiple apps, i.e. "sections" of the website
	  
	* apps are great in the sense that they can be drag and drop into other
	  website projects -> modularity
	  
	app folder structure:
	[app folder]             # this is the name of the folder
	 |____ __init__.py       # blank init file to indicate this is a package
	 |____ admin.py          #
	 |____ apps.py           #
	 |____[migrations]       #
	 |     |____ __init__.py #
	 |____ models.py         #
	 |____ tests.py          #
	 |____ views.py          #
	

- TO MAKE AN APP INSIDE A PROJECT:
	
	i) go to directory where manage.py is and run the ff command:
		"python manage.py startapp <name of app>"
		* this creates an app folder with specified name in that same dir.
		
	

  request -> project urls -> app urls -> response
